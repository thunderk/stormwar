For more todos, see the doxygen file block of each .h file.
There are also /*TODO:...*/ and /*FIXME:...*/ comments directly inside the code for little things that can wait.


Critical things to change/fix/add:
----------------------------------

    * Network:
        - Network currently write and read Float values from binary as Uint32, which may be wrong on several platforms.
          We must think of a platform-independent float coding for network transmission.
          See also about negative conversions.
        - Protect pv_NetworkConnection fields from concurrent accesses (make network thread-safe).
    * Game:
        - Game modules should only produce diffs if there are remote players connected.
        - Check that the player ID sent in orders match the connection.
    * Graphics:
        - GLEVENT_DRAW should be casted BEFORE drawings (and collectors should receive it before frame drawing).


Features to add:
----------------
    * Network:
        - Timeouts handling.
        - Spam protection (if a client sends too much packets, it will be blocked temporarily).
        - Packet validation (if the number of unvalidated packet is too high, maybe kick).
    * Gui:
        - Add a sort of GuiEventCallback to dialogs, to see if a field has been modified or validated.


Annoying bugs to fix:
---------------------
    - The game segfaults sometimes near the very beginning. Very hard to reproduce.
    - When the client name is already in use, the kick is done AFTER asking the server player a decision.
    - In windowed mode, mouse is sometimes at the edges causing scrolling (at startup and screen resizing).
    - When enlarging screen, edge objects are not drawn (the control points system keeps telling they are off-screen) until camera moves.
    - The sound is delayed under win32 platforms.


Major rewrites needed:
----------------------
    - Rewrite ground code to be more flexible and coherent.
    - guipiecelist and worldmap are quite a mess and could really be improved and optimized.


Major optimizations to do:
--------------------------
    - Game registers should use more pointers on algos (mostly for sections).


Code cleaning to do:
--------------------
    - ptrarray.h should have the pv_PtrArray structure private and replace macro use. Maybe use a single internal iterator
        (like in registers) rather than external iterators (may avoid the use of marks).


Tests to perform:
-----------------
    - Delete a permanently popped asynchronous queue while it is not empty to check if it exits before or after
      treating, or if it simply crashes.


Weird bugs to understand:
-------------------------
